## Session Rules
- Always read .work/PLAN.md, .work/FINDINGS.md, and .work/PROGRESS.md if they exist
- When I paste a re-entry prompt, treat it as ground truth for project state
- KNOWLEDGE.md writes: use `/remember` — never raw-append

## Current State
See .work/PLAN.md for active goals and progress.
See .memory/SESSION-LOG.md for recent session history.
